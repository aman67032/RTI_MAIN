                    <p data-full-text="The right to information in India has had a progressive constitutional journey. Initially, the Constitution of India did not explicitly recognize the right to information. However, through a series of judicial interpretations, the Supreme Court recognized it as part of the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). This article explores the evolution of information rights from early cases like S.P. Gupta v. Union of India (1982) to the enactment of the RTI Act in 2005. We examine the legal reasoning, constitutional principles, and global influences that shaped this journey toward transparency and accountability.">The right to information in India has had a progressive constitutional journey.

This article analyzes the Supreme Court's approach to balancing transparency with other public interests like national security and privacy.

The article discusses the proportionality test applied by courts, the concept of 'public interest override,' and the evolving jurisprudence on what constitutes 'larger public interest' that justifies disclosure of otherwise exempt information.">The Right to Information Act has been a powerful tool for promoting transparency in governance.

                    <p data-full-text="This article explores how the Right to Information Act has been used as a powerful tool for environmental protection in India. We examine case studies where RTI applications have exposed violations of environmental norms, illegal mining, forest encroachments, and pollution control failures. The article highlights how environmental activists and local communities have used RTI to challenge ecologically destructive projects, monitor Environmental Impact Assessments, and ensure compliance with environmental clearance conditions. We also analyze the challenges in obtaining environmental information, including the frequent invocation of commercial confidentiality exemptions by industries and the reluctance of pollution control boards to disclose monitoring data. The article concludes with recommendations for strengthening environmental transparency through proactive disclosure and citizen monitoring.">This article explores how the Right to Information Act has been used as a powerful tool for environmental protection in India.

We analyze the landmark Supreme Court judgment of 2019 that brought the office of the Chief Justice of India under the RTI Act, and its implications for judicial transparency.
