                    <p><strong>Judgment:</strong> In this landmark judgment, often referred to as the "First Judges Case," the Supreme Court recognized that the right to information is implicit in the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Court held that disclosure of information regarding the functioning of government is the rule and secrecy is an exception, justified only where disclosure would harm public interest.</p>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This judgment laid the foundation for the right to information in India, establishing it as a constitutional right even before the RTI Act was enacted.

                    <p><strong>Judgment:</strong> The Supreme Court held that the RBI cannot refuse to disclose information about banks under its supervision by claiming exemptions under Section 8(1)(d) (commercial confidence) or 8(1)(e) (fiduciary relationship) of the RTI Act. The Court emphasized that the RBI has a statutory duty to uphold public interest and not the interest of individual banks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This judgment established that regulatory bodies cannot shield information about regulated entities by claiming exemptions under the RTI Act.

                    <p><strong>Judgment:</strong> The Supreme Court held that personal information of public servants, including details of their assets, income tax returns, and service records, is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act unless there is a larger public interest justifying disclosure.

                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>In 2010, RTI activist Simpreet Singh filed multiple RTI applications that exposed the Adarsh Housing Society scam in Mumbai. The RTI queries revealed how apartments meant for war widows and veterans were illegally allocated to politicians, bureaucrats, and their relatives. The information obtained through RTI showed violations of environmental norms, building regulations, and land ownership rules.</p>
                    <p>The revelations led to a CBI investigation, the resignation of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and criminal proceedings against several officials. This case demonstrates how RTI can be a powerful tool against corruption and misuse of power at the highest levels of government.</p>

                    <p>In the early 2000s, before the national RTI Act was passed, the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) used the Rajasthan RTI Act to obtain copies of muster rolls (attendance registers) and payment records for public works under employment guarantee schemes in Bhilwara district. Through public hearings (jan sunwais), they compared these records with actual work done and wages received by workers.</p>
                    <p>The RTI-enabled social audits revealed massive corruption, including ghost workers, inflated measurements, and siphoning of funds. This grassroots use of information led to recovery of misappropriated funds, disciplinary action against corrupt officials, and systemic reforms in the implementation of rural employment schemes.</p>

                    <p>In 2007-2008, RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal and Parivartan used the RTI Act to obtain records of ration distribution in Delhi.

                    <p>The information obtained through RTI led to public hearings where beneficiaries could verify the records against what they had actually received.

                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>In 2009, medical student Saurabh Yadav used the RTI Act to obtain information about the admission process in private medical colleges in Karnataka. The information revealed that many colleges were not following the prescribed admission criteria and were admitting students with lower ranks while rejecting those with higher ranks.</p>
                    <p>Based on this information, a public interest litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court, which led to the cancellation of irregular admissions and the establishment of a more transparent counseling process for medical college admissions. This case demonstrates how RTI can be used to ensure fairness in educational opportunities.</p>
