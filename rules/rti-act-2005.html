                <h2>Introduction to the RTI Act</h2>
                <p>The Right to Information Act 2005 is an Act of the Parliament of India which sets out the rules and procedures regarding citizens' right to information. Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen of India may request information from a "public authority" which is required to reply expeditiously or within 30 days.</p>
                <p>The Act also requires every public authority to computerize their records for wide dissemination and to proactively publish certain categories of information so that citizens need minimal recourse to request for information formally.</p>
