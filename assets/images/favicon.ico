This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

Since we can't directly create binary ICO files through text editing, you'll need to:
1. Use the SVG version we created (favicon.svg)
2. Convert it to ICO format using an online converter or image editing software
3. Replace this file with the actual ICO version

The ICO file should contain multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) for best compatibility across browsers.
